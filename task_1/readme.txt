Image Gallery Walkthrough
I have successfully designed and implemented a premium image gallery with the following features:

Responsive Grid Layout: Auto-adjusts columns based on screen size.
Glassmorphism Design: Dark theme with translucent, blurred elements.
Category Filtering: Smoothly filters images by category (Nature, City, Architecture, Abstract).
Interactive Lightbox: Full-screen image view with navigation controls.
Verification Results
1. Initial Load & Design
The gallery loads with a premium dark aesthetic. Hover effects on cards reveal the title and category.

2. Category Filtering
Clicking the "Nature" filter hides other categories and only shows nature-themed images.


3. Lightbox Functionality
Clicking an image opens the lightbox with a backdrop blur. The image is centered, and details are shown below.


4. Navigation
Users can navigate between images within the lightbox using the arrow buttons.

Here is a recording of the automated verification session demonstrating the flow:
